The excerpt reflects growing discord between the North and the South over the expansion of slavery in new western territories. Congressional leaders such as Clay sought to defuse these sectional tensions through the Compromise of 1850, which among other provisions, admitted California as a free state, allowed popular sovereignty to determine the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession, and provided for a strengthened Fugitive Slave Act.</p>",

Although the excerpt references the banning of slavery from the Old Northwest through the Northwest Ordinance (1787), the states in the Great Lakes region did not express an interest in introducing slavery within their borders because their geography did not encourage plantation-style agriculture.</p>",

The excerpt does not address the United States Supreme Court decision in the Dred Scott case, which was not decided until 1857. This decision rejected African American citizenship rights and forced free states to recognize the slave status of enslaved migrants from the South, which increased sectional tensions in the United States rather than reducing them.</p>"

In the excerpt, Clay is concerned that the issue of slavery in the new territories would further divide the country along sectional lines.

It is a decision made by California herself, and which California had incontestably a right to make under the Constitution of the United States. . . .

Tensions over slavery accelerated after the Dred Scott decision as antislavery arguments became a major platform issue for several Northern political parties. In addition to the political reaction, there were also more radical responses. John Brown’s raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia and his attempt to provoke a slave revolt in 1859 was partially inspired by a reaction to the Dred Scott decision.</p>",

The Republican Party emerged following the Dred Scott decision partially to advocate restrictions on the expansion of slavery to western territories and future states. While many Republicans were vocal abolitionists and wanted the immediate end of slavery, others had been free soilers, and though opposed to slavery, sought to isolate its existence and use other methods to see its demise.</p>",

Although the question of whether to allow slavery in territories gained following the Mexican-American War was intense, the war was fought from 1846 to 1848, several years before the Dred Scott decision was issued. Instead, the decision led to growing support at the time for the Republican Party.</p>",

The Southern block of slave states did not begin to secede from the United States until after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860 because it was believed that he would begin to limit the expansion of slavery, if not attempt to abolish it entirely. Instead, the decision led to growing support at the time for the Republican Party.</p>"

Southern Democrats were the most vocal supporters of slavery and generally believed that individual states, not the federal government, had the authority to regulate slavery as they saw fit. Because the United States Constitution did not specifically address the regulation of slavery, proslavery Democrats used the Tenth Amendment to argue that it was unconstitutional for the federal government to dictate how states enacted laws regulating slavery.</p>",

The Dred Scott decision would allow for the expansion of slavery in opposition to the desires of the free soilers.</p>",

While the platform of the Republican Party did not call for the elimination of slavery entirely during the 1850s, members wanted to prevent its expansion, which the Dred Scott decision permitted. In addition, Northern Republicans opposed this decision because many worried that Southern influence in Congress would grow as new states admitted to the Union would be pressured to be proslavery.</p>"

The final triumph of the counterrevolution awaited the withdrawal of northern Republican support from the so-called ‘carpetbag regimes’ in 1877. The inconsistency of federal Reconstruction policy and the strength of southern resistance seem to have doomed the Reconstruction experiment to inevitable collapse. Although Americans have often been loathe to concede that violence may bring about [political] change, terrorism in the Reconstruction era was instrumental in achieving the ends desired by its perpetrators.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">George C.

As violence persisted, Congress enacted a far more sweeping measure—the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 1871. This for the first time designated certain crimes committed by individuals as offenses punishable under federal law. . . . If states failed to act effectively against them, [these offenses could] be prosecuted by federal district attorneys, and even lead to military intervention. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Judged by the percentage of Klansmen actually indicted and convicted, the fruits of ’enforcement’ seem small indeed, a few hundred men among the thousands guilty of heinous crimes. But in terms of its larger purposes—restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling blacks to exercise their rights as citizens—the policy proved a success. . . . So ended the Reconstruction career of the Ku Klux Klan. . . .

Continuing a long pattern of American . . . behavior, many whites found an outlet for their frustration by attacking those deemed responsible for their suffering: white Republicans and blacks. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Frustrated at their inability to bring their states back to Democratic control, some southerners turned to the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations, using terrorism to eliminate opposition leaders and to strike fear into the hearts of rank-and-file Republicans, both black and white. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“[Violence] in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina exposed the impotence of the Republican party in the South and the determination of Democrats to defeat their opponents by any means necessary. The final triumph of the counterrevolution awaited the withdrawal of northern Republican support from the so-called ‘carpetbag regimes’ in 1877. The inconsistency of federal Reconstruction policy and the strength of southern resistance seem to have doomed the Reconstruction experiment to inevitable collapse. Although Americans have often been loathe to concede that violence may bring about [political] change, terrorism in the Reconstruction era was instrumental in achieving the ends desired by its perpetrators.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">George C. Rable, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction</span>, published in 1984</p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">“In its pervasive impact and multiplicity of purposes, . . . the wave of counterrevolutionary terror that swept over large parts of the South between 1868 and 1871 lacks a counterpart . . . in the American experience. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“By 1870, the Ku Klux Klan . . . had become deeply entrenched in nearly every Southern state. . . . In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired the restoration of white supremacy. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Adopted in 1870 and 1871, a series of Enforcement Acts embodied the Congressional response to violence. . . . As violence persisted, Congress enacted a far more sweeping measure—the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 1871. This for the first time designated certain crimes committed by individuals as offenses punishable under federal law. . . . If states failed to act effectively against them, [these offenses could] be prosecuted by federal district attorneys, and even lead to military intervention. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Judged by the percentage of Klansmen actually indicted and convicted, the fruits of ’enforcement’ seem small indeed, a few hundred men among the thousands guilty of heinous crimes. But in terms of its larger purposes—restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling blacks to exercise their rights as citizens—the policy proved a success. . . . So ended the Reconstruction career of the Ku Klux Klan. . . . National power had achieved what most Southern governments had been unable, and Southern white public opinion unwilling, to accomplish: acquiescence in the rule of law.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Eric Foner, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877</span>, published in 1988</p></div></div></div>",

The argument that the racial system in the South remained largely unchanged after Reconstruction does not contradict Grimsley’s argument in the excerpt that the federal government failed to respond to a conservative insurgency against state governments in the South during Reconstruction.

The argument that some supporters of women’s rights opposed the expansion of African American rights does not contradict Grimsley’s argument in the excerpt that the federal government failed to respond to a conservative insurgency against state governments in the South during Reconstruction. Rather this argument would support Grimsley’s claim, as the reduced support among some women’s rights activists—many of whom were Northerners who advocated that White women should have voting rights before African American men—for African American rights parallels Grimsley’s argument that federal leaders and Northern soldiers did not take sufficient action to protect African Americans’ rights throughout Reconstruction.</p>",

The argument that many African Americans in the South felt politically empowered after the end of slavery directly contradicts Grimsley’s argument in the excerpt that the federal government failed to respond to a conservative insurgency against state governments in the South during Reconstruction. As discussed by Grimsley, a main target of this insurgency was African Americans, whom the insurgents sought to politically disempower through violent intimidation to further their goal of taking control of Southern state governments away from Republicans. Grimsley’s argument emphasizes that African Americans were hindered from using their new rights despite the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</p>"

Like any other states in the Union, these were expected to provide for their own security. Anxious to gain political legitimacy in the eyes of a white population who largely regarded them as ‘regimes,’ these state governments had strong reasons to downplay the subversive activities within their borders. Instead, . . . they respected the civil liberties of ex-Confederates and, with only a few exceptions, permitted their bitterest foes full participation [in] the political process.

The claims to states’ rights under the federal system best represent a continuity with pre–Civil War Southern society as suggested by the events in the excerpt. The conservative insurgents against Southern Republican state governments described in the excerpt were opposed to the exertion of federal authority over the former Confederate states and ultimately used states’ rights claims after the end of Reconstruction to pass laws that enforced racial segregation and curtailed African Americans’ voting rights despite the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Similarly, prior to the Civil War, Southerners used states’ rights to defend the institution of slavery and to facilitate and justify the westward expansion of the system.</p>",

Although the excerpt describes the dominance of the Republican Party in Southern state governments after the Civil War, these governments were not dominated by the Republican Party before the Civil War.

The growth of a movement to expand the rights of African Americans does not represent a continuity with pre–Civil War Southern society suggested by the events in the excerpt. Although the excerpt describes some limited expansion of the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction, pre–Civil War Southern society did not have an extensive movement to expand the rights of African Americans. While there was resistance against slavery by enslaved African Americans in the South prior to the Civil War, the vast majority of White Southerners sought to curtail the rights of African Americans to reinforce the racial hierarchy and promote the cotton economy that supported the growth of the institution of slavery in this period.</p>",

The political revolts by White Americans against state government authority do not best represent a continuity with pre–Civil War Southern society as suggested by the events in the excerpt. Although the excerpt describes conservative Southerners in political revolt against the Republicans in state governments during Reconstruction, White Southerners in pre–Civil War society did not revolt against the political authority of their state governments. Instead, White Southerners often strongly supported their state governments, claiming that these governments’ authority over many issues, such as slavery, was independent of the federal government and could not be interfered with.</p>"

The events described in the excerpt best support the argument that Reconstruction created only temporary political opportunities for formerly enslaved people. Although African Americans voted and held political office during Reconstruction under new Republican state governments that acknowledged the citizenship and civil rights of formerly enslaved people, by the late 1870s the lack of federal protection for the Republican state governments and the violent campaigns of intimidation conducted by the Ku Klux Klan described in the excerpt contributed to Democrats retaking control of Southern state governments and denying African Americans their rights.</p>",

The events described in the excerpt do not best support the argument that the Union army took extensive measures to reorder race relations in the South. Rather, the events described show army officers during Reconstruction failing to protect Republican state governments and weakly responding to the vigilante activities of the Ku Klux Klan that limited the ability of African Americans to make use of the civil rights and voting rights guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</p>",

The events described in the excerpt do not best support the argument that African Americans were opposed to Southern Republican state governments. Rather, the events described show violent activity against these state governments motivated by the White racial hostility and opposition against the political empowerment of African Americans by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. The Southern Republican state governments described in the excerpt were generally supported by African Americans because the Republican Party advocated for civil rights for formerly enslaved people.</p>",

The events described in the excerpt do not best support the argument that Northern resolve to engage in Reconstruction began to wane in the mid-1870s. Rather, they show a situation where soon after 1865 at the beginning of Reconstruction the federal government already did not acknowledge or address Southern resistance against the Republican-dominated state governments formed after the defeat of the Confederacy and the implementation of Radical Reconstruction.</p>"

The ideas expressed in the excerpt were not a reaction to the migration of United States settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains. Although the migration of United States settlers to the west contributed to tensions with Great Britain in the years before the War of 1812, United States migration did not contribute to the international tensions in the 1790s that led President Washington to advocate for neutrality, as he did in the excerpt.</p>",

The ideas expressed in the excerpt were not a reaction to the expansion of Spanish missions in California. Although tensions existed between the United States and Spain over commercial access to the Mississippi River in the 1790s, the United States made no claim to California at this time, and the existence of Spanish missions there did not contribute to the international conflict in which the President Washington supported United States neutrality.</p>",

The ideas expressed in the excerpt were not a reaction to the election of Thomas Jefferson as president. Jefferson was elected to the presidency in 1800, after Washington had issued his Farewell Address and therefore Jefferson’s election could not have contributed to the ideas contained in the speech.</p>",

The ideas expressed in the excerpt were most directly a reaction to the revolutionary government. In the years after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, France and Great Britain went to war and Americans were divided between supporting the two sides. To avoid this internal conflict and the threat of war with France or Great Britain, President Washington declared United States neutrality in 1793 and continued to advocate it in his Farewell Address.</p>"
